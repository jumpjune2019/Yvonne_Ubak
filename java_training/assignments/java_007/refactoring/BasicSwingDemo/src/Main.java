		- Create the frame on the event dispatching thread.

		- This is a standard way of ensuring our app works.
		- The “invokeLater” method will ensure the thread is 
		  scheduled at some point in Java’s scheduler.
		- The class Main and its public static void main are 
		  also thread, but a public static void main is an 
		  implicit call the GUI is meant to work another thread(s).
		- The “invokeLater” method ensure this thread is managed 
		  in a way that behind the scene the Java developer is 
		  not burdened with dealing in GUI related operations at
		  the OS level as opposed to using a command prompt 
		  output which is sequential in nature.
		- GUIs are meant to respond to events and as such asynchronous.
